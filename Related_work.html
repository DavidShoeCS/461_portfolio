<h4 style="text-align:center"> Flix Finder Website </h4>

<h5>
  This web application is a tool to find any released movie, accompanied by a description, images, and ratings.
  The application offers filtering tools to narrow down searches based on type of movie, for example animations, ratings received, and genre of movie.
  This application was created with a team of 4, each taking on different tasks to meet the submittal deadline. The application was designed and styled with HTML,
  CSS. The functionality of the website was created using JavaScript. The movie data displayed was gathered using API calls to OMDB(Online Movie Data Base). We 
  implemented caching as to not make extra calls to the API unless needed, storing previous searches in cache files for the user.
