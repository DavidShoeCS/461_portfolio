  Hello, my name is David Shoemaker. I am a senior at Oregon State University pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science, with a focus on cyber security.
  I have had a passion for computers and technology for as long as I can remember. I enjoy being challenged and solving problems where the solutions aren't
  immediately evident.
